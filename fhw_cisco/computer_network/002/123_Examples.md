## 12.3 WLAN Operation

- 12.3.2 **802.11 Wireless Topology Modes**


- 12.3.6 **Wireless Client and AP Association**

    In order to have a successful association, a wireless client and an AP must agree on specific parameters. Parameters must then be configured on the AP and subsequently on the client to enable the negotiation of a successful association.

    **SSID** - The SSID name appears in the list of available wireless networks on a client. In larger organizations that use multiple VLANs to segment traffic, each SSID is mapped to one VLAN. Depending on the network configuration, several APs on a network can share a common SSID.

    **Password** - This is required from the wireless client to authenticate to the AP.

    **Network mode**  - This refers to the 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ad WLAN standards. APs and wireless routers can operate in a Mixed mode meaning that they can simultaneously support clients connecting via multiple standards.

    **Security mode**  - This refers to the security parameter settings, such as WEP, WPA, or WPA2. Always enable the highest security level supported.

    **Channel settings**  - This refers to the frequency bands used to transmit wireless data. Wireless routers and APs can scan the radio frequency channels and automatically select an appropriate channel setting. The channel can also be set manually if there is interference with another AP or wireless device.
