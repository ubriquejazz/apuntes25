## 12.5 Channel Mgmt 

- 12.5.2 **2.4GHz Overlapping Channels**

    The 2.4 GHz band is subdivided into multiple channels. Each channel is allotted 22 MHz bandwidth and is separated from the next channel by 5 MHz. The 802.11b standard identifies 11 channels for North America, (13 in Europe and 14 in Japan).

- 12.5.3 **5GHz First Eight Non-Interfering Channels**

    The 5 GHz band is divided into three sections. Each channel is separated from the next channel by 20 MHz. The figure shows all 24 Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NNI) 24 channels for the 5 GHz band. Although there is a slight overlap at the tails of each channel's frequency, the channels do not interfere with one another. 5 GHz wireless can provide faster data transmission for wireless clients in heavily populated wireless networks because of the large amount of non-overlapping wireless channels.
