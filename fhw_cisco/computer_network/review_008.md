20. List the layers of the OSI reference model. Outline the function of each layer.

________________________________________________________________________

A committee of the International Standards Organisation (ISO) developed a seven layer reference model known as the standard for “Open System Interconnection” (OSI) which defines what functions and services should be provided at each layer of a generic network.
•  The ISO OSI model is only intended to be a standard to match other network protocols to.
•  If a network conforms to one or more layers of the model then other networks that also do (*) can talk to it

7. APPLICATION: Network services
- provides network services to app processes 
- such as electronic mail, file transfer and terminal emulation

6. PRESENTATION: Data representation.
- insure data is readable by receiving system.
- format of data, data structures...

5. SESSION: Interhost communication
- establishes, manages and terminates sessions between applications

4. TRANSPORT: End-to-end connections
- concerned with transportation issues betweens hosts
- establish, maintain, terminate virtual circuits (socket)
- fault detection and recovery

3. NETWORK: Address and best path
- path selection between 2 end systems
- domain of routing

2. DATA LINK: Access to media
- provides reliable transfer of data across media
- physical addressing, network topology
- error notification, flow control

1. PHYSICAL: Binary transmission
- wires, connectors, voltages, data rates
