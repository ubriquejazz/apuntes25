1. Draw diagrams of the main types of network topology (ring, star, hierarchical etc.) and list the relative merits of each.

2. Explain the differences between baseband, broadband and ADSL. Which system would home WIFI use?

Data travels over media using baseband or broadband
• Baseband is one data channel per media item
• Broadband is more than one data channel per media item
• Over a wire or radio this is done by using multiple frequencies or by splitting up the time (TDM)
• The term Broadband is often used in the UK to refer to what is properly known as Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)

ADSL is the system used by most home users to connect to the internet. 
• It transmits three data channels at different frequencies (hence the name Broadband) over a standard telephone line (subscriber line). 
• The three channels are called upstream, downstream and POTS.
• POTS is Plain Old Telephone System! (the standard voice telephone channel)
• Each channel has a different bandwidth (range of frequencies), hence the term “asymmetric”.

In an office or company environment however it is normal for devices to use baseband to talk locally over a separate wiring system (ie. not over the phone system).

The main exception is where WIFI which is a broadband technology as data is sent over multiple radio channels using different frequency bands (FDM).
